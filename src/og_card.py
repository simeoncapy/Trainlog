"""The picture a shared Trainlog link unfurls into.

Same renderer as the Discord trip card (src/trip_card) and deliberately
simpler: a link preview is shown small and next to the poster's own text, so it
carries the route and a single caption line rather than the card's four rows of
operator detail. It also covers *sets* of trips, since a month, a tag or a
multi-trip selection all share one URL for many.

Rendering goes through Martin, which is slow and non-concurrent, so every card
is written to databases/cache and served from there afterwards. The cache key
is the trip ids and the caption, both of which change when the page does, so
nothing has to expire it.
