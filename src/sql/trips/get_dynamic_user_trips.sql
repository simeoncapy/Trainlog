-- PostgreSQL. Builds the FilteredTrips CTE consumed by the dynamic-trips
-- endpoint, which appends "SELECT COUNT(*)/SELECT * FROM FilteredTrips [WHERE ...]
-- [ORDER BY ...] [LIMIT/OFFSET]". Columns are aliased to the legacy SQLite `trip`
-- names (uid, type, purchasing_date) so the appended filters/sorts keep working;
-- rows are adapted back to the legacy shape in Python (adapt_pg_trip_row).

-- roughly halving the count-query cost. The ticket-name match is done there as a
-- correlated EXISTS on ticket_id, so this CTE no longer needs to join tickets.
