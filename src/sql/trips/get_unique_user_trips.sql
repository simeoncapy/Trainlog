-- Unique routes for a user's map (one representative trip per distinct
-- route + year + temporal category). Returns the representative trip's full
-- datetime/type columns so the map frontend (new_map.html) can read
-- start_datetime/type and run computeTimeStatus; rows are passed through
-- adapt_pg_trip_row in Python to get legacy names and the 1/-1 date sentinels.
