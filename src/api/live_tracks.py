"""Live tracking of in-progress flights.

A flight logged before it happens has no real route: it is saved as a 2-point LINESTRING
and drawn as a geodesic. That looks obviously fake next to a completed leg whose real,
wind-blown track came from the FR24 import — which can only run once the flight has landed.

While the flight is actually airborne, FR24 will serve the flown-so-far track (verified: the
tracks endpoint returns a partial trail whose last point is seconds old). So we fetch it and
draw the flown portion for real, leaving only the remainder estimated.

Cost control is the whole design problem here, since a map view must not map 1:1 onto a paid
API call. It is handled by making the refresh floor *per trip and globally shared* rather than
per viewer: however many people are looking at a flight, it is refreshed at most once every
LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL, and that refresh is charged to the traveller. A viewer therefore cannot
burn credits by reloading. See _refresh_if_stale for the three guards that enforce this.
