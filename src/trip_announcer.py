"""Post a user's trips to Discord as they depart.

Several users type their trips into the Discord channel by hand as they take
them, having already logged the same trip here. This posts it for them.

Scheduling, without a scheduler
-------------------------------
Trainlog is a request/response Flask app with no cron, no celery and no
gateway process, so the announcer is a daemon thread started at import time —
the same shape as the email listener. Two things make that safe under gunicorn,
where the thread runs in *every* worker:

* Before a trip is posted, a row is claimed with ``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO
  NOTHING RETURNING``. Exactly one worker gets the row back, and only that one
  calls Discord. Duplicate posts are therefore impossible however many workers
  run, and a restart mid-tick cannot repost.
* Only departures inside a short window are eligible, so an outage means a few
  missed posts rather than a flood of stale ones when the app comes back.

The window is matched on ``utc_start_datetime``, the only comparable clock
across users in different time zones; what gets *printed* is the trip's local
time, which is what the traveller would have typed themselves.

Posting by hand
---------------
The announcer only posts inside a short window at departure, so a trip logged
late, or one that fell in an outage, would never make it out. ``post_trip_now``
lets the owner post it themselves from the trips table for as long as they are
travelling (an hour either side of the trip, ``MANUAL_POST_GRACE``). Bounding it
that way keeps the channel meaning "somebody is on their way" and makes it
impossible to empty a whole trip history into it. The claim row is the same one
the announcer takes, so a trip posted by hand is not posted again at departure.

Taking a post down again
------------------------
A trip posted while it was public by mistake says where somebody is, so the
owner can delete their own post from the trips table (``retract_announcement``,
reached from the actions menu). The claim row stays behind with its
``message_id`` cleared: a trip whose post was taken down is never announced a
second time, which is what someone who just took one down would expect.
