"""Date-range pseudo-tags: every trip a user made in a year, month, week or day.

These behave like a tag that nobody has to create and that nobody has to keep
up to date — the id list is resolved on every request, so a trip logged later
shows up on the page it belongs to:

    /public/simfr24/year/2026
    /public/simfr24/month/2026-10
    /public/simfr24/week/2026-W40
    /public/simfr24/day/2026-10-01

The window is matched against ``start_datetime``, which is the trip's local
departure time, so a 23:30 departure belongs to the day it felt like rather
than to whatever the UTC clock said.

Labels stay in ISO form ("2026-10") rather than "October 2026": month names
would need 12 new strings in each of the 25 locales, and ISO reads the same in
all of them.
